## Development
* Install node dependencies: `cd demo-server`, then `npm install`
* Serve audio files for development `npm start`

## Production
* Update the `FILE_PATH` in `js/player.js` to the URL of production server (e.g. `https://foobar.com`)
* Deploy files to the server specified

Note: the current file paths assume that audio will be served from `/audio`
